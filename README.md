# Hackathon_Project_1
----------------------------Automated Post------------------------
I have used Node.js ad puppeteer to make this project. 
In this project, I have shown "How to post a picture with messages, fully automated" . 
It is a chain process , majorly done with the help of "Promise Chaining" rather than using "Async Function".
